# Agent memory & consolidation across agents

Different agents (Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Gemini) each keep their own private memory and
transcript. AIMS does **not** merge those. Instead it consolidates the two things that actually need
to be shared — **rules** and **work** — on a substrate every agent already understands: files and git.

## Three layers

| Layer | Shared across agents? | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Rules** (how to behave, which commands) | ✅ yes | `aims wire-agents` writes one AIMS block into each agent's config file |
| **Work** (what was done: sessions, decisions) | ✅ yes | sessions live on `origin`; any agent runs `aims adopt` and continues from artifacts |
| **Live context** (an agent's reasoning/transcript) | ❌ no, by design | stays local & tool-specific — see [COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md) |

## 1. Consolidate rules — one source, every agent

`aims wire-agents` (run automatically by the bootstrap, or manually anytime) writes an identical,
marker-delimited AIMS block into each agent's config:

- `~/AGENTS.md` — opencode & Codex (project/home)
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` — Codex global
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code
- `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` — Gemini CLI

Every agent then maps the same natural-language intent to the same `aims` command. Re-running
refreshes the block in place; it is idempotent.

### Add your own rules alongside AIMS

The AIMS block is delimited by markers:

```
<!-- >>> AIMS agent rules >>> -->
...AIMS content (managed by aims wire-agents)...
<!-- <<< AIMS agent rules <<< -->
```

Put **your** project rules **outside** those markers (above or below). `aims wire-agents` only touches
what is between them, so your rules survive every refresh. This is how you consolidate *your own*
conventions across all agents too: write them once per file (or share a snippet) outside the block.

## 2. Consolidate work — git is the shared memory

The durable "what happened" lives in each session's `worklog.md` + commits on `origin`, not in any
agent's transcript. So:

- Any agent, on any machine, runs `aims adopt <session-id>` and continues **from artifacts**.
- Hand a session between agents/machines with `aims handoff` → `aims adopt`.
- Because the record is git, it outlives the agent that created it and is readable by every tool.

This is deliberate: an agent must leave a self-sufficient handover (worklog + commits), never rely on
its private context travelling. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 3. What stays private (and why)

Each agent's live transcript/reasoning is local, tool-specific, and not synced. Trying to merge those
across tools is brittle (incompatible formats, machine-bound paths). AIMS keeps the shared memory in
the two places that are portable — rules (files) and work (git) — and leaves the rest local.

## TL;DR

- **Same rules everywhere** → `aims wire-agents`.
- **Same work everywhere** → sessions on `origin`, `aims adopt`.
- **Private context** → stays with each agent, on purpose.
